  The idea for eigen. Advertisement came from observing advertisement placements on a bus. We saw an advertisement for a lawyer and thought it would a great idea  to create a sharing economy for advertising to promote local businesses at affordable prices. Ultimately, the idea is to use everyday vehicles on the road, which have a ton of free space, to advertise for local businesses.



  Local and small businesses are always looking for affordable ways to advertise and we wanted to solve this problem by having an option for branding and advertising at cheaper rates using current vehicles already on the roads. Both drivers and local businesses benefit from this sharing model.

  The entire idea for eigen. Advertisements is a fairly new and unique concept that works similarly to other businesses such as Uber and AirBnB. This business model allows local businesses to benefit through inexpensive advertising costs and  drivers benefit by earning income for placing ads on their vehicle. This sharing economy approach means anybody with a vehicle can potentially contribute and earn income from having advertisements placed on their vehicles.
  
  

  The other aspect of our company that really sets us apart is our ability to ship ads anywhere in the world. This will allow our company to grow significantly in a variety of different markets globally.
